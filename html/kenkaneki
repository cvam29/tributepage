<p>Ken Kaneki (金木研, Kaneki Ken) is an one-eyed ghoul,<br>
     who is currently living under the identity of<br> 
     Haise Sasaki (佐々木琲世, Sasaki Haise) — <br>
     the First Rank Ghoul Investigator — also known as <br>
      Eyepatch (眼帯, Gantai)
    
</p>
<p>  After being captured by Aogiri Tree,<br>
     the traumatic events he went through led him to be able to accept his Ghoul-side.<br>
     Escaping it, Ken formed a team with the goal — in mind — of protecting the ones that <br>
     are precious to him and specifically "picking out" people, who, threaten the place he belongs to.<br>
     Eventually, Ken achieved a Kakuja through cannibalization with a distinct appearance,<br>
     which caused CCG to nickname him Centipede (百足, Mukade)s.

<p id="tribute-info">In Tokyo Ghoul:re -<br>
     the continuation of the series — taking three years after the official,<br>
     Haise Sasaki becomes his identity.<br>
     He serves now as a First Rank Investigator as the mentor of the CCG's Quinx Squad<br>
     and a team member of Team Mado. However, Haise cannot re-call anything before his 20th year,<br> 
     indicating that his memories of his past have been lost, leaving him unaware of his true self.<br>
     In Season 1:Episode 2, Kaneki's hair turned white because he is a old ass bitch and is somewhat<br>
     badass but for most of the anime he was a little pussy bitch
